# GitNet: CI Tools and Libraries for F#

Partas.GitNet provides a CI runtime built ontop of [LibGit2Sharp](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp) that utilises [ConventionalCommits v1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and a custom flavor of SemVer to provide automated, but internally independent versioning for mono repos!

The runtime is specifically designed for F# projects, but can be configured for other projects too.

At the end, you also get a customised [KeepAChangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)-like [markdown file](https://github.com/shayanhabibi/Partas.Solid.Bindings/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md)!

> The project is still under development and might have some kinks. Use judiciously.
